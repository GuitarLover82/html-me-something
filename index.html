      <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>Music has always been the most important thing in my life.
            Most of my earliest memories are of myself listening to my father's vast record collection.
            As I got older, I discoverd "live music!" Music means differnt things to different people, 
            and some people prefer different aspects of music than others. My personal favorite thing about music 
            is seeing it performed live. I've been to too many concerts to count, but I would like to go over some of my
            favorite concerts and why they were my fovorites. The concerts I'll be discussing are:
          <ul>
            <li>Phish Big Cypress 1999</li> 
            <li>David Gilmour 2015</li>
            <li>Roger Waters 2017</li>
            <li>Brian Wilson 2016</li> 
          </ul>

    <h2>Phish Big Cypress 1999</h2>
      <p>I first saw Phish in 1996, and, ever since then, they've been one of my favorite bands.
          There's a lot about Phish that sets them apart from every other band, but a few of the most important things are that no 2 shows are the 
          same (every show has a differnt setlist of songs) and that everytime they play a song they play it differently. Becaouse of this, people 
          travel all over the country to see their concerts, because each one is a different experience. You can watch a small viedo of Phish playing their song <em>"The Divided Sky"</em> <a scr="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=phish+divided+sky+clifford+ball" here. I've personally seen Phish almost 100 times, 
          but one of the highlights for me was attending thier 1999-2000 New Years Festival held on the Big Cypress Seminole Reservation. It was during 
          this festival that they performed one of the most famous sets in their entire career. At about 11:55 pm on 12/31/1999 they started playing the final
          set of that year. What no one in that crowd could have anticipated is that when they started that set they wouldn't stop playing until the sun rose on 
          01/01/2000 (about 7 hours later)! While every Phish fan has their "magical sets", I still consider that last set from Big Cypress to 
          be one of the best perfomances I've ever seen!

    <h2> David Gilmour 2015</h2>
      <p>Another one of my favorite bands is Pink Floyd. Even though the band broke up in 1980, the members still tour the world
          perfoming their music which has impacted countless lives, including mine. David Gilmour was Pink Floyd's Guitar Player for most of 
          their career. As a guitar player myself, when I found out that one of my all time favorite guitarists from one of my all time favorite bands
          was playing in Chicago, I decided I had to be there! I drove to Chicago with one of my dearest friends and long-time bandmate, and the show we saw that night was
          indiscribable. There were points where we were in pure awe, and during several songs we were drawn to tears. Altogether, it was 
          one of the most emotional concerts I've ever been to, and I feel extra blessed that I got to share the experience with such a dear friend!

    <h2>Roger Waters 2017</h2>
      <p>As I mentioned in my rundown of the David Gilmour concert, Pink Floyd is one of my favorite bands. Roger Waters was the bass player 
          and lead vocalist for most of their career. While both Waters and Gilmour still tour playing the music of Pink Floyd, the concerts are 
          completely different experences. One important thing to note is that because of legal reasons surrounding the breakup of Pink Floyd, each member has
          copyrights to different songs, so Gilmour can perform some songs that Waters can't and vice versa. But, that's not all that separates the two. While Gilmour
          tries to make his performances almost note-for-note recreations of the Album Version of each song, Waters takes a different approach. Roger Waters considers
          the thatrical aspect of a concert just as important as the music being played. I've seen Roger Waters several times, but the show in 2017 was by far the best I've seen. 
          He took songs written 40 years earlier and combined them with images of what's going on in the world today. In doing so he showed just how timeless those songs are!
