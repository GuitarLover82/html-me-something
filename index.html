      <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>Music has always been the most important thing in my life.
            Most of my earliest memories are of myself listening to my father's vast record collection.
            As I got older, I discoverd "live music!" Music means differnt things to different people, 
            and some people prefer different aspects of music than others. My personal favorite thing about music 
            is seeing it performed live. I've been to too many concerts to count, but I would like to go over some of my
            favorite concerts and why they were my fovorites. The concerts I'll be discussing are:
          <ul>
            <li>Phish Big Cypress 1999</li> 
            <li>David Gilmour 2015</li>
            <li>Roger Waters 2017</li>
            <li>Brian Wilson 2016</li> 
          </ul>

    <h2>Phish Big Cypress 1999</h2>
      <p>I first saw Phish in 1996, and, ever since then, they've been one of my favorite bands.
          There's a lot about Phish that sets them apart from every other band, but a few of the most important things are that no 2 shows are the 
          same (every show has a differnt setlist of songs) and that everytime they play a song they play it differently. Becaouse of this, people 
          travel all over the country to see their concerts, because each one is a different experience. I've personally seen Phish almost 100 times, 
          but one of the highlights for me was attending thier 1999-2000 New Years Festival held on the Big Cypress Seminole Reservation. It was during 
          this festival that they performed one of the most famous sets in their entire career. At about 11:55 pm on 12/31/1999 they started playing the final
          set of that year. What no one in that crowd could have anticipated is that when they started that set they wouldn't stop playing until the sun rose on 
          01/01/2000 (about 7 hours later)! While every Phish fan has their "magical sets", I still consider that last set from Big Cypress to 
          be one of the best perfomances I've ever seen! <br>

    <h2> David Gilmour 2015</h2>
      <p>Another one of my favorite bands is Pink Floyd. Even though the band broke up in 1980, the members still tour the world
          perfoming their music which has impacted countless lives, including mine. David Gilmour was Pink Floyd's Guitar Player for most of 
          their career. As a guitar player myself, when I found out that one of my all time favorite guitarists from one of my all time favorite bands
          was playing in Chicago, I decided I had to be there! I drove to Chicago with one of my dearest friends and long-time bandmate, and the show we saw that night was
          indiscribable. There were points where we were in pure awe, and during several songs we were drawn to tears. Altogether, it was 
          one of the most emotional concerts I've ever been to, and I feel extra blessed that I got to share the experience with such a dear friend!<br>
          You can watch a viedo of David Gilmour playing one of the most famous Pink Floyd songs,<em>"Comfortably Numb"</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTseTg48568"

    <h2>Roger Waters 2017</h2>
      <p>As I mentioned in my rundown of the David Gilmour concert, Pink Floyd is one of my favorite bands. Roger Waters was the bass player 
          and lead vocalist for most of their career. While both Waters and Gilmour still tour playing the music of Pink Floyd, the concerts are 
          completely different experences. One important thing to note is that because of legal reasons surrounding the breakup of Pink Floyd, each member has
          copyrights to different songs, so Gilmour can perform some songs that Waters can't and vice versa. But, that's not all that separates the two. While Gilmour
          tries to make his performances almost note-for-note recreations of the Album Version of each song, Waters takes a different approach. Roger Waters considers
          the thatrical aspect of a concert just as important as the music being played. I've seen Roger Waters several times, but the show in 2017 was by far the best I've seen. 
          He took songs written 40 years earlier and combined them with images of what's going on in the world today. In doing so he showed just how timeless those songs are!<br>
          I'll provide you with a link to Roger Waters performing an extremely, politcally and emotionally version of the Pink Floyd song, <em>"pigs" </em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWLBtMz5OuY" target="_blank" here>here.</a>

    <h2>Brian Wilson 2017</h2>
      <p>I saved Brian Wilson for last, because this show was special to me in so many ways! The Beach Boys were my First "favorit band". I was about five years-old when I bought my first casette tape, and it was a Beach Boys album.
        I fell in love with there unrivaled harmonies and the carefree attitude the music had. When I was about nine years-old, I developed Major Depressive Disorder that I still deal with to this day. Ever since then, music has been the 
        most therapeutic influence in my life. When I was in my teens, I discoved a Beach Boys album called "Pet Sounds." Unlike every other Beach Boys album, "Pet Sounds" doesn't have that carefree vibe to it. It was clearly written by a young
        man who was struggling with depression and trying to deal with it through his music and in his personal life; that young man was Brian Wilson. I could relate to every word sung on that album, and, to this day, I still consider it the best "rock album" 
        of all time. Like myself, Brian Wilson has spent his entire life struggling with mental illness. After "Pet Sounds" was released, Brian Wilson's illness became so severe that he had to stop performing live, but The Beach Boys continued without him.
        The year 2017 marked the 50th anniversery of the release of "Pet Sounds", and, to the surprise of millions of lifelong fans, Brian Wilson announced he would do a tour commemerating the anniversery, 
        and that each show would include a set where he played the album "Pet Sounds" in it's entirety. I was one of the lucky few that got to attend one of those shows. Being such a huge fan of The Beach Boys and especially "Pet Sounds", I can't describe how much that
        concert meant to me! I've been to thousands of concerts, and I know that Brian Wilson 2017 will always be one of the most significant concerts I've ever been privleged to attend!<br>
      Even though I reccommed listening to the Album "Pet Sounds" in it's entirety, I've attached a link to my favorite song, <em>"I Just Wasn't Made for these Times"</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR7_TbMIVnA" target="_blank" here>here.</a>
